# TwoTabs


This project is example for using of Angular components, services and routing. The application is deviated to the follow parts:

### Components 
 - delete-button
 - input-field
 - error-message
 - tab1 - contains input field and dropdown with two options
 - tab2 - contains input field and list with the added inputs
 - tab-controller
 - app-component - the app entry point 

### Services
- tab-services
- storage-service

### Error Handling
- error-handler

The project is implemented with thoughts to be extended - adding new tabs and replace the local storage with different sources. 


The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
